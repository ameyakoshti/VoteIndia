Syed Mir Qasim,12 December 1971,25 February 1975,Jammu_and_Kashmir,Syed Mir Qasim (Kashmiri: ?????? ??? ??????  ??? ??? ???) was the Chief Minister of Kashmir from 1971?1975 and well-respected throughout India as a gentleman politician and statesman. He was noted for his tenacious courage and cool sagacity. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described Syed Mir Qasim as a "great nationalist who worked selflessly in public interest and for peace and development in Jammu and Kashmir. " Indian Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi noted that "in the death of Qasim  the country has lost one of its pre-eminent political personalities  who symbolised our ethos of secular nationalism. " Well-respected across the political spectrum  Syed Mir Qasim's advice and counsel was sought out by every Indian Prime Minister from Nehru to Vajpayee. Syed Mir Qasim's political career first began during India's freedom struggle against Britain  when he became a leader of the non-sectarian  pro-democracy Quit Kashmir political movement. His advocacy against monarchical rule resulted in his imprisonment as a political prisoner by the Maharaja of Kashmir Hari Singh. After India's independence  Syed Mir Qasim drafted the Kashmiri constitution and went on to serve in various State and Union positions. He is credited for having established the Indian National Congress (also known as the Congress Party and abbreviated INC) in Kashmir. Syed Mir Qasim most famously offered to resign from the office of Chief Minister in order to encourage and institutionalize the landmark Indira Gandhi-Sheikh Abdullah Accord in 1975. Syed Mir Qasim suddenly died in an ambulance near India Gate in New Delhi on 12 December 2004 at the age of 83  thirty-three years to the date from when he became Chief Minister in 1971. In accordance with his wishes  he was buried in the remote village of his birth  Dooru in Kashmir. Notably  given the general level of violent upheaval in Kashmir  his funeral was attended by thousands without incident. He was posthumously awarded India's highest civilian award by Indian President APJ Abdul Kalam in 2005.

K. Karunakaran,25 March 1977,25 April 1977,Kerala,Kannoth Karunakaran (Malayalam: ??. ??????????; July 5  1918 ? December 23  2010) was a senior stalwart politician from Kerala  India belonging to Indian National Congress party and was a close lieutenant of former Prime Ministers of India Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. Kannoth Karunakaran was a former Chief Minister of Kerala  Home Minister of Government of Kerala  and Cabinet Minister for Industries of Government of India. He was one of the most influential  prominent and controversial persons in Kerala politics for at least four decades and was affectionately called "Leader" by Congress activists. K. Karunakaran is often regarded a master tactician  the "king" of Kerala state politics  and political troubleshooter at national level  and the creator of United Democratic Front. As a member of the Congress Party he was elected seven times to the Kerala Legislative assembly between 1965 and 1995 and served as Chief Minister three times. In 2005 owing to differences with Sonia Gandhi and then Kerala Chief Minister  Oommen Chandy he acrimoniously split from the Congress Party and formed a breakaway party called the Democratic Indira Congress (Karunakaran). Democratic Indira Congress (Karunakaran) played a significant role in Kerala politics during its brief history. As a partner of both the LDF and the UDF at different times  it has been a major factor in success and failure for the two coalitions. In November 2006 the party merged with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)  a member of the LDF. Later  K. Karunakaran and his daughter Padmaja returned to Indian National Congress following a spilt. However his son K. Muraleedharan dissociated himself from his father and continued in NCP. Karunakaran died on 23 December 2010 aged 92 at Ananthapuri Hospital in Thiruvananthapuram. He was often criticized for nepotism. Karunakaran?s dominating presence in the Congress party as well as other factors resulted in growing factionalism within the Kerala section of the Congress party. Karunakaran and A. K. Antony were dubbed as the political Tom and Jerry equivalents for their intra-party activities. Karunakaran was noted for his steadfast devotion for Lord Krishna at the Guruvayur temple.@en,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kerala_Pradesh_Congress_Committee,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Karunakaran,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/K_Karunakaran.jpg/200px-K_Karunakaran.jpg,

A.K. Antony,27 April 1977,27 October 1978,Kerala,
P. K. Vasudevan Nair,29 October 1978,7 October 1979,Kerala,Padayatt Kesavapillai Vasudevan Nair  popularly known as PKV  was the 9th Chief Minister of Kerala and a senior leader of the Communist Party of India (CPI). His father was Kesava Pillai. He began his political life as a student activist while studying in Union Christian College  Aluva  when the whole country was in upheaval having entered the final phase of freedom struggle. After graduating in Physics he went for study law at Government Law College  Thiruvananthapuram. PKV had his baptism in politics during his students days as an activist of the All India Students Federation (AISF). The initial years were tumultuous as AISF  which was part of the then undivided Communist Party of India (CPI)  was fighting against British imperialism. Then he joined the Communist Party of India in 1945 like many young radicals of his time who thought Congress too moderate and pro-rich. The subsequent years saw him evolve as a student and youth leader. He was the president of Travancore Students? Union in 1947 and elected as President of All Kerala Students Federation in 1948. PKV faced his first arrest during those days for making a speech against the royal ruler of Travancore. PKV was among hundreds of communists who went underground when the Communist Party of India was banned following its adoption of the Calcutta Thesis that called for armed struggle against the ruling government in 1948. He took part in underground activities from 1948?51 and was arrested in 1951 in connection with students' movement. P K Vasudevan Nair and Balraj Sahani backed the idea of All India Youth Federation. Delhi's firebrand youth leader  Guru Radha Kishan was very active in organising the first national conference of AIYF in Delhi  this wholehearted effort was visible when more than 250 delegates and observers across India representing several youth organizations of various states attended this conference. PKV had acted as president of All Kerala Students Federation  All India Youth Federation (AIYF) and Vice President of World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY). When the Communist Party split in 1964  he threw his lot with the CPI. After a long national parliamentary career  PKV returned to state politics in 1970s and was elected to the Kerala Assembly in 1977 in the election held after the Emergency. He was the Industries Minister in the Karunakaran and A.K. Antony ministries from April 1977 to October 1978. When Antony resigned in 1979 protesting against the Congress' choice of Indira Gandhi as a candidate in Chikmagalur Lok Sabha by-election  PKV became Chief Minister with the support of the Congress on October 29  1978 and occupied the post till 7 October 1979. PKV  who never went after positions  threw away his Chief Ministership after a year in office to realise the alliance with the CPI-M  ushering in an era of Left unity in the country which lead to the formation of Left Democratic Front (LDF). Suave and soft-spoken  PKV had over the years earned several friends cutting across political lines. From 1982 to 2004  PKV had stayed away from electoral politics  concentrating his time and energy on the organisational front. During this period  he mostly served as the state secretary of CPI. Whether in or out of power  he always kept a simple lifestyle and had been accessible to all sections of people.

C. N. Annadurai,14 January 1969,3 February 1969[23],Tamil_Nadu,Conjeevaram Natarajan Annadurai (Tamil: ??????????? ??????? ?????????) (15 September 1909 ? 3 February 1969)  popularly called Anna (Tamil: ?????  ?elder brother")  or Arignar Anna (Anna the scholar) was a former Chief Minister of the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. He was the first member of a Dravidian party to hold that post and was also the first non-Congress leader to form a majority government in independent India. He was well known for his oratorical skills and was an acclaimed writer in the Tamil language. He scripted and acted in several plays. Some of his plays were later made into movies. He was the first politician from the Dravidian parties to use Tamil cinema extensively for political propaganda. Born in a middle-class family  he first worked as a school teacher  then moved into the political scene of the Madras Presidency as a journalist. He edited several political journals and enrolled as a member of the Dravidar Kazhagam. As an ardent follower of Periyar E. V. Ramasamy  he rose in stature as a prominent member of the party. With differences looming with Periyar  on issues of separate independent state of Dravida Nadu and on inclusion in the Indian Union  he crossed swords with his political mentor. The antipathy between the two finally erupted when Periyar married Maniammai  who was much younger than him. Angered by this action of Periyar  Annadurai with his supporters parted from Dravidar Kazhagam and launched his own party  Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The DMK initially followed ideologies the same as the mother party  Dravidar Kazhagam. But with the evolution of national politics and the constitution of India after the Sino-Indian war in 1963  Annadurai dropped the claim for an independent Dravida Nadu. Various protests against the then ruling Congress government took him to prison on several occasions; the last of which was during the Madras anti-Hindi agitation of 1965. The agitation itself helped Annadurai to gain popular support for his party. His party won a landslide victory in the 1967 state elections. His cabinet was the youngest at that time in India. He legalised Self-respect marriages  enforced a two language policy (in preference to the three language formula in other southern states)  implemented subsidies for rice  and renamed Madras State to Tamil Nadu. However  he died of cancer just two years into office. His funeral had the highest attendance of any to that date  earning it a Guinness record. Several institutions and organisations are named after him. A splinter party launched by M. G. Ramachandran in 1972 was named after him as Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.@en,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._N._Annadurai,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/C.N.Annadurai.jpg/200px-C.N.Annadurai.jpg,

Si?h; 23 December 1902 ? 29 May 1987) was the fifth Prime Minister of the Republic of India  serving from 28 July 1979 until 14 January 1980. Born into a Jat family in 1902  Charan Singh entered politics as part of the Independence Movement. After independence he became particularly notable in the 1950s for opposing and winning a battle against Nehru's socialistic and collectivist land use policies  for the sake of the Indian Farmer  which endeared him to the agrarian communities throughout the nation  particularly in his native Uttar Pradesh. The leader of the Bharatiya Lok Dal  a major constituent of the Janata coalition  he was disappointed in his ambition to become Prime Minister in 1977 by Jayaprakash Narayan's choice of Morarji Desai. He settled at the time for the largely honorary post of Deputy Prime Minister of India. During 1977 Lok Sabha Elections  there was not a single party  hence it was problem  which symbol has to be adopted (many parties joined the front to contest the elections after emergency was over). Hence  a request was made to Chaudhary Charan Singh (Lok Dal) and he agreed to release his party-Lok Dal's symbol "HALDHAR'. This symbol was locked in that elections  but a promise was made to Chaudhary Charan Singh that he would be Prime Minister if the front won that election  but this promise was never kept by other party leaders  hence Chaudhary Charan Singh had a knot in his heart  resulting in a revolt; when the time came he became Prime Minister. However  the internal stresses of the coalition's government caused him to leave the government with the former Lok Dal  after being promised by Indira Gandhi the support of the Congress Party on the floor of the House in any efforts to form a government. He was sworn in as Prime Minister with the support of just 64 MPs. Charan Singh holds the record of the sole Prime Minister of India who did not face the Loksabha even for a single day during his short tenure of just a month. The day before the Lok Sabha was due to meet for the first time the Indian National Congress withdrew their support from his Bharatiya Lok Dal Government. Choudhary Charan Singh resigned and fresh elections were held six months later. He continued to lead the Lok Dal in opposition till his death in 1987  when he was succeeded as party president by his son Ajit Singh. His association with the causes dear to farming communities in the North caused his memorial in New Delhi to be named Kisan Ghat. (In Hindi  Kisan is the word for farmer. ) The Amausi Airport in Lucknow  Uttar Pradesh is also called as Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport after him. The university of Meerut city in Uttar Pradesh  India  is also named after him (Chaudhary Charan Singh University).@en,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Janata_Party_(Secular),http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charan_Singh,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Charan_Singh_(cropped).jpg/200px-Charan_Singh_(cropped).jpg,
