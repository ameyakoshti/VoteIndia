Bihar has distinction of giving the world its first democracy through Lichchivi (modern days Vaishali) during ancient era. Since the late 1970s  Bihar lagged behind other Indian states in social and economic development terms. Economists and social scientists claimed that this is a direct result of the policies of the central government  such as the freight equalization policy  its apathy towards Bihar  lack of Bihari sub-nationalism (resulting in no spokesperson for the state)  and the Permanent Settlement of 1793 by the British East India Company. The state government has however made significant strides in improving governance. The improved governance has led to an economic revival in the state through increased investment in infrastructure  better health care facilities  greater emphasis on education  and a diminution in crime and corruption. Indian and global business and economic leaders feel that Bihar now has good opportunity to sustain its growth and thus they have shown interest in investing in the state.

It is the second most populous metropolis in India after Mumbai and the largest city in terms of area. With a population of 22 million in 2011, the city is also the fourth most populous metropolis in the world. The NCT and its urban region have been given the special status of National Capital Region under the Constitution of India's 69th amendment act of 1991. The NCR includes the neighbouring cities of Baghpat, Gurgaon, Sonepat, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida and other nearby towns, and has nearly 22.2 million residents. Although technically a federally administered union territory, the political administration of the NCT of Delhi today more closely resembles that of a state of India with its own legislature, high court and an executive council of ministers headed by a Chief Minister. New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal Government of India and the local Government of Delhi, and is the capital of the NCT of Delhi. Delhi is known to have been continuously inhabited since the 6th century BC. Through most of its history, Delhi has served as a capital of various kingdoms and empires. It has been captured, sacked and rebuilt several times, particularly during the medieval period, and therefore the modern conurbation of Delhi is a cluster of a number of cities spread across the metropolitan region. Delhi is believed to have been the site of Indraprastha, the legendary capital of the Pandavas during the times of the Mahabharata. Delhi re-emerged as a major political, cultural and commercial city along the trade routes between northwest India and the Gangetic plain during the period of the Delhi sultanates. In AD 1639, the Mughal emperor Shahjahan built a new walled city in Delhi which served as the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1649 until the Rebellion of 1857. The British captured Delhi in 1857 and the city replaced Kolkata as the seat of British government in India in 1911. A new capital city, New Delhi, was built to the south of the old city during the 1920s. When the British left India in 1947, New Delhi became the national capital and seat of government. Today Delhi contains many important historical monuments, buildings and features." .

The name Haryana is found mentioned in the 12th century AD by the Apabhramsha writer Vibudh Shridhar. It is bordered by Punjab and Himachal Pradesh to the north  and by Rajasthan to the west and south. The river Yamuna defines its eastern border with Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. Haryana also surrounds the country's capital Delhi on three sides  forming the northern  western and southern borders of Delhi. Consequently  a large area of south Haryana is included in the National Capital Region for purposes of planning for development. Sites in Haryana were part of the Indus Valley and Vedic Civilizations. Several decisive battles were fought in the area  which shaped much of the history of India. These include the epic battle of Mahabharata at Kurukshetra mentioned in the Hindu mythology (including the recital of the Bhagavad Gita by Krishna)  and the three battles of Panipat. Haryana was administered as part of the Punjab province of British India  and was carved out on linguistic lines as India's 17th state in 1966. Haryana is now a leading contributor to the country's production of foodgrain and milk. Agriculture is the leading occupation for the residents of the state  the flat arable land irrigated by submersible pumps and an extensive canal system. Haryana contributed heavily to the Green Revolution that made India self-sufficient in food production in the 1960s. Haryana is also one of the wealthier states of India and had the third highest per capita income in the country at Rs.108 859 in the year 2011-12 and Rs.128 341 in the year 2012-13 including the largest number of rural crorepatis in India. Haryana is also one of the most economically developed regions in South Asia and its agricultural and manufacturing industry has experienced sustained growth since 1970s. Haryana is India's largest manufacturer of passenger cars  two-wheelers  and tractors. Since 2000  the state has emerged as the largest recipient of investment per capita in India. The city of Gurgaon has rapidly emerged as a major hub for the information technology and automobile industries. Gurgaon is home to Maruti Suzuki  India's largest automobile manufacturer  and Hero MotoCorp  the world's largest manufacturer of two-wheelers.

It was created on 1 November 1956  with the passage of the States Reorganisation Act  which is celebrated annually as Karnataka Rajyotsava (English: Formation Day). Originally known as the State of Mysore  it was renamed Karnataka in 1973. It is the land of the Kannadigas  Tuluvas  Konkanis and Kodavas. The capital and largest city is Bangalore  also known as Bengaluru  which is at the forefront of the rapid economic and technological development that India is experiencing. Karnataka is bordered by the Arabian Sea and the Laccadive Sea to the west  Goa to the north west  Maharashtra to the north  Andhra Pradesh to the east  Tamil Nadu to the south east  and Kerala to the south west. The state covers an area of 191 976 square kilometres  or 5.83 per cent of the total geographical area of India. It is the eighth largest Indian state by area. With 61 130 704 inhabitants at the 2011 census  Karnataka is the ninth largest state by population  comprising 30 districts. Kannada is the most widely spoken and official language of the state. The two main river systems of the state are the Krishna and its tributaries  the Bhima  Ghataprabha  Vedavathi  Malaprabha  and Tungabhadra  in the north  and the Kaveri and its tributaries  the Hemavati  Shimsha  Arkavati  Lakshmana Thirtha and Kabini  in the south. Both these rivers flow out of Karnataka eastward into the Bay of Bengal. Though several etymologies have been suggested for the name Karnataka  the generally accepted one is that Karnataka is derived from the Kannada words karu and n?du  meaning \"elevated land\". Karu nadu may also be read as karu  meaning \"black\"  and nadu  meaning \"region\"  as a reference to the black cotton soil found in the Bayalu Seeme region of the state. The British used the word Carnatic  sometimes Karnatak  to describe both sides of peninsular India  south of the Krishna. With an antiquity that dates to the paleolithic  Karnataka has been home to some of the most powerful empires of ancient and medieval India. The philosophers and musical bards patronised by these empires launched socio-religious and literary movements which have endured to the present day. Karnataka has contributed significantly to both forms of Indian classical music  the Carnatic and Hindustani traditions. Writers in the Kannada language have received the most number of Jnanpith awards in India.@en" .

It was formed on 1 November 1956 per the States Reorganisation Act by combining various Malayalam-speaking regions. Spread over 38 863\u00A0km with a population of 33 387 677  it is bordered by Karnataka to the north and north east  Tamil Nadu to the east and south  and the Laccadive Sea to the west. Thiruvananthapuram is the state capital among the 14 districts; other major cities include Kochi  Kozhikode  Kollam and Thrissur. The region had been a prominent spice exporter from 3000 BCE to 3rd century. The Chera Dynasty was the first powerful kingdom based in Kerala  though it frequently struggled against attacks from the neighbouring Cholas and Pandyas. During the Chera period Kerala remained an international spice trading center. Later  in the 15th century  the lucrative spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala  and eventually paved the way for the European colonisation of the whole of India. After independence  Travancore and Cochin joined the Republic of India and Travancore-Cochin was given the status of a state. Later  the state was formed in 1956 by merging the Malabar district  Travancore-Cochin (excluding four southern taluks)  and the taluk of Kasargod  South Kanara. With a population of 33 388 000 in 2011  Kerala has the lowest population growth rate; 3.44% and a density of 819 people per km.

It also has the highest literacy rate; 93.91%  the highest life expectancy; 74 years and the highest sex ratio; 1 083 women per 1000 men among the Indian states. Kerala has the lowest homicide rate among Indian states  for 2011 it was 1.1 per 100 000. A survey in 2005 by Transparency International ranked it as the least corrupt state in the country. Kerala has witnessed significant emigration of its people  especially to the Persian Gulf countries during the Kerala Gulf boom during the 70s and early 80s  and its economy depends significantly on remittances from a large Malayali expatriate community. Hinduism is practised by the half of the population  followed by Islam and Christianity. Malayalam is the major spoken language. It is considered as the \"cleanest state in India\"  however  the morbidity rate  at 118  is the highest in the country. Culture of the state traces its roots from 3rd century CE. It is a synthesis of Aryan and Dravidian cultures  developed over centuries under influences from other parts of India and abroad. Production of pepper and natural rubber contribute to a prominent part of the total national output. In the agricultural sector  coconut  tea  coffee  cashew and spices are important. The state has 590\u00A0km of coastal belt  and around 1.1 million people of the state are dependent on the fishery industry which contribute to 3% income of the state. With 145 704 kilometres of roads  the state constitutes 4.2% of total India's roadways. There are three existing and two proposed international airports. Waterways are also used as means of transportation. The state has the highest media exposure in India with newspapers publishing in nine different languages; mainly English and Malayalam.

With over 75 million inhabitants  it is the sixth largest state in India by population. It borders the states of Uttar Pradesh to the northeast  Chhattisgarh to the southeast  Maharashtra to the south  Gujarat to the west  and Rajasthan to the northwest. The area covered by the present-day Madhya Pradesh includes the area of the ancient Avanti mahajanapada  whose capital Ujjain (also known as Avanti) arose as a major city during the second wave of Indian urbanization in the sixth century BCE. Subsequently  the region was ruled by the major dynasties of India  including the Mauryans  the Mughals and the Marathas. By the early 18th century  the region was divided into several small kingdoms which were captured by the British and incorporated into Central Provinces and Berar and the Central India Agency. After India's independence  Madhya Pradesh state was created with Nagpur as its capital: this state included the southern parts of the present-day Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. In 1956  this state was reorganized and its parts were combined with the states of Madhya Bharat  Vindhya Pradesh and Bhopal to form the new Madhya Pradesh state with Bhopal as its capital. This state was the largest state of India by area until 2000. In 2000  the Chhattisgarh region was split to create a new state  and Rajasthan became the largest state of India. Madhya Pradesh is home to a large tribal population  which has been largely cut-off from the mainstream development. This makes Madhya Pradesh one of the least developed states in India  with an HDI (Human Development Index) value of 0.375 (2011)  which is below the national average. The state's per-capita gross state domestic product (nominal GDP) is the fourth lowest in the country (2010\u201311). MP is also the lowest-ranked state on the India State Hunger Index. In the recent years  the state's GDP growth has been above the national average. The state is rich in mineral resources  and has the largest reserves of diamond and copper in India. More than 30% of its area is under the forest cover. Its tourism industry has seen considerable growth  with the state topping the National Tourism Awards in 2010-11.@en" .

Maharashtra is the wealthiest state in India  contributing 15% of the country's industrial output and 13.3% of its GDP (2006\u20132007 figures). Maharashtra is bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west  Gujarat and the Union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli to the northwest  Madhya Pradesh to the north and northeast  Chhattisgarh to the east  Karnataka to the south  Andhra Pradesh to the southeast and Goa to the southwest. The state covers an area of 307 731 km or 9.84% of the total geographical area of India. Mumbai  the capital city of the state  is India's largest city and the financial capital of the nation. Nagpur is the second (Winter) capital of the state. Marathi is the state's official language. Maharashtra is the world's second most populous first-level administrative country sub-division.

In the 17th century  the Marathas rose under the leadership of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj against the Mughals  who ruled a large part of India. By 1760  Maratha power had reached its zenith with a territory of over 250 million acres (1 million km\u00B2) or one-third of the Indian sub-continent. After the Third Anglo-Maratha War  the empire ended and most of Maharashtra became part of Bombay State under a British Raj. After Indian independence  Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti demanded unification of all Marathi-speaking regions under one state. At that time  Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was of the opinion that linguistic reorganization of states should be done on a \"One state \u2013 One language\" principle and not on a \"One language \u2013 One state\" principle. He submitted a memorandum to the reorganization commission stating that a \"single government can not administer such a huge state as United Maharashtra\". The first state reorganization committee created the current Maharashtra state on 1 May 1960.

Five mountain ranges run north to south  with intervening valleys  while to the west Agartala  the capital  is located on a plain. The state has a tropical savanna climate  with seasonal heavy rains from the south west monsoon. Forests cover more than half of the area  in which bamboo and cane forests are common. Tripura has the highest number of primate species found in any Indian state. The area of modern Tripura was part of an independent Tripuri kingdom that ruled for several centuries. It was a princely state during British rule  and joined the newly-independent India in 1949. Ethnic strife between the indigenous people and Bengali population has led to tension and scattered violence since its integration into the country  but the establishment of an autonomous tribal administrative agency and other strategies have soothed such conflicts. The state is peaceful as of 2012. Tripura lies in a geographically disadvantageous location in India  as only one major highway connects it with the rest of the country. This hinders the economic prospects of the state. Poverty and unemployment continue to plague Tripura  which has a limited infrastructure. Most residents are involved in agriculture and allied activities  although the service sector is the largest contributor to the state's gross domestic product. Indigenous communities  known in India as Scheduled tribes  constitute about 30 per cent of the population. The Kokborok-speaking Tripuri people form the major group among 19 tribes and many other subtribes; Bengali people form the ethno-linguistic majority.

It was created on 1 April 1937 as the United Provinces with the passing of the States Reorganisation Act and renamed Uttar Pradesh in 1950. Lucknow is the capital of Uttar Pradesh and Kanpur is the economic and industrial capital of Uttar Pradesh while the state high court is in Allahabad. On 9 November 2000  a new state  Uttarakhand  was carved from the mountainous Himalayan region of Uttar Pradesh. The state is bordered by Rajasthan to the west  Haryana and Delhi to the northwest  Uttarakhand and the country of Nepal to the north  Bihar to the east  Jharkhand to the southeast  and Madhya Pradesh to the southwest. It covers 93 933 square miles  equal to 6.88% of the total area of India  and is the fifth largest Indian state by area. With over 200 million inhabitants as of 2011  it is the most populous state in the country as well as the most populous country subdivision in the whole world. Hindi is the official and most widely spoken language in its 75 districts. Uttar Pradesh is the second largest Indian state by economy  with a GDP of 7px708000\u00A0crore . Agriculture and service industries are the largest parts of the state's economy. The service sector comprises travel and tourism  hotel industry  real estate  insurance and financial consultancies.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Uttarakhand> <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description> "Uttarakhand/??t?r?? kh?nd/  formerly Uttaranchal  is a state in the northern part of India. It is often referred to as the \"Land of the Gods\" due to the many holy Hindu temples and pilgrimage centres found throughout the state. Uttarakhand is mainly known for its natural beauty of the Himalayas  the Bhabhar and the Terai. On 9 November 2000  this 27th state of the Republic of India was carved out of the Himalayan and adjoining northwestern districts of Uttar Pradesh. It borders the Tibet Autonomous Region on the north; the Mahakali Zone of the Far-Western Region  Nepal on the east; and the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh to the south and Himachal Pradesh to the northwest. The state is divided into two divisions  Garhwal and Kumaon  with a total of 13 districts. The provisional capital of Uttarakhand is Dehradun  the largest city in the region  which is a railhead. The high court of the state is in Nainital. Archaeological evidence support the existence of humans in the region since prehistoric times. Among the first major dynasties of Garhwal and Kumaon were the Kunindas in the 2nd century BCE who practised an early form of Shaivism. Ashokan edicts at Kalsi show the early presence of Buddhism in this region. During the medieval period the region was consolidated under the Kumaon and Garhwal kingdom. By 1803 the region fell to the Gurkha Empire of Nepal and with the conclusion of the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1816 most of modern Uttarakhand was ceded to the British as part of the Treaty of Sugauli. Although the erstwhile hill kingdoms of Garhwal and Kumaon were traditional rivals  the proximity of different neighbouring ethnic groups and the inseparable and complementary nature of their geography  economy  culture  language  and traditions created strong bonds between the two regions which further strengthened during the movement for statehood in the 1990s. The natives of the state are generally called either Garhwali or Kumaoni depending on their place of origin. According to the 2011 census of India  Uttarakhand has a population of 10 116 752  making it the 19th most populous state in India. A large portion of the population consists of Rajputs and Brahmins. More than 88% of the population follow Hinduism. Muslims are the largest minority in the state with Sikhs  Christians  Buddhists  and Jains being the other major religions. Garhwali and Kumaoni are the two main regional languages  whereas Hindi is the most widely spoken language. Two of the most important rivers in Hinduism originate in the region  the Ganga at Gangotri and the Yamuna at Yamunotri. These two along with Badrinath and Kedarnath form the Chota Char Dham  a holy pilgrimage for the Hindus. The state hosts the Bengal tiger in Jim Corbett National Park  the oldest national park of the Indian subcontinent. The Valley of Flowers  a Unesco World Heritage Site located here  is known for the variety and rarity of the flowers and plants found there.@en" .

It is also the seventh-most populous sub-national entity in the world  with over 91 million inhabitants. Spread over 34 267\u00A0sq\u00A0mi  it is bordered by the countries of Nepal  Bhutan  and Bangladesh  and the Indian states of Odisha  Jharkhand  Bihar  Sikkim  and Assam. The state capital is Kolkata (formerly Calcutta). West Bengal encompasses two broad natural regions: the Gangetic Plain in the south and the sub-Himalayan and Himalayan area in the north. Ancient Bengal was the site of several major janapadas  including Vanga  Rarh  Pundra and Suhma. In the 2nd century BC  the region was conquered by the emperor Ashoka. In the 4th century AD  it was absorbed into the Gupta Empire. From the 13th century onward  the region was ruled by several sultans  powerful Hindu states and Baro-Bhuyan landlords  until the beginning of British rule in the 18th century. The British East India Company cemented their hold on the region following the Battle of Plassey in 1757  and Calcutta served for many years as the capital of British India. The early and prolonged exposure to British administration resulted in expansion of Western education  culminating in development in science  institutional education  and social reforms of the region  including what became known as the Bengal Renaissance. A hotbed of the Indian independence movement through the early 20th century  Bengal was divided during India's independence in 1947 along religious lines into two separate entities: West Bengal\u2014a state of India\u2014and East Bengal\u2014a part of the newly-created Pakistan\u2014later becoming Bangladesh in 1971. A major agricultural producer  West Bengal is the sixth-largest contributor to India's net domestic product. Noted for its political activism  the state was ruled by democratically elected communist government for three decades. West Bengal is noted for its cultural activities and presence of cultural and educational institutions; the state capital Kolkata is known as the \"cultural capital of India\". The state's cultural heritage  besides varied folk traditions  ranges from stalwarts in literature including Nobel-laureate Rabindranath Tagore to scores of musicians  film-makers and artists. West Bengal is also distinct from most other Indian states in its appreciation and practice of playing soccer besides the national favourite sport cricket.@en" .

Nagar Haveli is wedged between Maharashtra and Gujarat, whereas Dadra is an enclave lying a few kilometres north of Nagar Haveli in Gujarat. Its capital is Silvassa. The territory lies some ten to thirty kilometres up-river from the city of Daman. Dadra and Nagar Haveli are in the watershed of the Daman Ganga River, which flows through the territory. The towns of Dadra and Silvassa lie on the north bank of the river. The Western Ghats range rises to the east, and the foothills of the range occupy the eastern portion of the district. The territory is landlocked, although the Arabian Sea coast lies just to the west in Gujarat. The major spoken languages in the territory are Gujarati, Hindi and Marathi. To keep the British at bay and to enlist their support against the Moghals, the Marathas made friends with the Portuguese and signed with them a treaty in 1779. According to this historic treaty of friendship, the Maratha-Peshwa agreed that the Portuguese will be allowed to collect revenues from Dadra and Nagar Haveli which consisted of 72 villages . These territories were earlier ruled by the Koli chiefs who were defeated by the Hindu kings of Jawhar and Ramnagar. The Marathas conquered and annexed these territories to their kingdom. By and large, this treaty was signed only to the extent that the Portuguese will only collect the revenue in compensation for their loss of a warship called Santana which had earlier been captured by the Marathas but not surrendered to the Portuguese in spite of their many entreaties. The area of Dadra and Nagar Haveli is spread over 491 km, landlocked between Gujarat to the north and Maharashtra to the south. It was liberated from its Portuguese rulers on 2 August 1954. The people of the territory established free administration of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, which was finally merged into the Union of India in 1961." .

The archipelago is a Union Territory and is governed by the Union Government of India. They were also known as Laccadive Islands  although geographically this is only the name of the central subgroup of the group. Lakshadweep comes from \"Lakshadweepa\"  which means \"one hundred thousand islands\" in Sanskrit as well as many Indian languages like Hindi  Malayalam  Kannada  Telugu and others. The islands form the smallest Union Territory of India: their total surface area is just 32 square kilometres . The lagoon area covers about 4 200 square kilometres  the territorial waters area 20 000 square kilometres and the exclusive economic zone area 400 000 square kilometres . The region forms a single Indian district with ten sub divisions. Kavaratti serves as the capital of the Union Territory and the region comes under the jurisdiction of Kerala High Court. The islands are the northernmost of the Lakshadweep-Maldives-Chagos group of islands  which are the tops of a vast undersea mountain range  the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge. As the islands do not have any aboriginal groups  different views have been postulated by the scholars about the history of habitation on these islands. Archaeological evidence support the existence of human settlement in the region around 1500 BC. The islands have long been known to sailors  as indicated by an anonymous reference from the first century AD to the region in Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. The islands were referenced also in the Buddhist Jataka stories of the 6th century BC. The arrival of Muslim missionaries around 7th century led to the advent of Islam in the region. During the medieval period the region was ruled by the cholas and Kingdom of Cannanore. The Portuguese arrived around 1498 and were upstaged by 1545. The region was then ruled by the Muslim house of Arakkal  followed by Tipu Sultan. On his death in 1799 most of the region passed on to the British and with their departure the Union Territory was formed in 1956. Ten of the islands are inhabited. As per the 2011 Indian census the population of the Union Territory is 64 429. The majority of the indigenous population is Muslim and most of them belong to the Shafi School of the Sunni Sect. The islanders are ethnically similar to the Malayali people of the nearest Indian state of Kerala. Most of the population speaks Malayalam with Mahi (or Mahl) being the most spoken language in Minicoy island. The islands are served by an airport on the Agatti island. The main occupation of the people is fishing and coconut cultivation  with tuna being the main item of export.@en" .
