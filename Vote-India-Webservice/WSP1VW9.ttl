He led an important administration  overseeing a major economic transformation and several home incidents affecting national security of India. Rao who held the Industries portfolio was personally responsible for the dismantling of the Licence Raj as this came under the purview of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. He is often referred to as the \"Father of Indian Economic Reforms\". Future prime ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh would continue the economic reform policies pioneered by Rao's government. Rao accelerated the dismantling of the License Raj  reversing the socialist policies of Rajiv Gandhi's government. He employed Dr. Manmohan Singh as his Finance Minister to embark on historic economic transition. With Rao's mandate  Dr. Manmohan Singh launched India's globalisation angle of the reforms that implemented the International Monetary Fund (IMF) policies to rescue the almost bankrupt nation from economic collapse. Rao was also referred to as Chanakya for his ability to steer tough economic and political legislation through the parliament at a time when he headed a minority government. Rao's term as Prime Minister was an eventful one in India's history. Besides marking a paradigm shift from the industrialising  mixed economic model of Jawaharlal Nehru to a market driven one  his years as Prime Minister also saw the emergence of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)  a major right-wing party  as an alternative to the Indian National Congress which had been governing India for most of its post-independence history. Rao's term also saw the destruction of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya which triggered one of the worst Hindu-Muslim riots in the country since its independence. Rao died in 2004 of a heart attack in New Delhi. He was cremated in Hyderabad.@en" .

He has been viewed by some as the most popular chief minister of Andhra Pradesh. His popularity is often attributed to the welfare schemes and development programs he championed for the people of his state. The BBC  for instance  called him a champion of social welfare schemes. Reddy was elected to the 9th  10th  11th  and 12th Lok Sabha from the Kadapa constituency for four terms and to the Andhra Pradesh Assembly for five terms from the Pulivendula constituency. He won every election he contested. In 2003 he undertook a three-month-long paadayaatra  or walking tour of 1475?km during the very hot summer months  across several districts in Andhra Pradesh as a part of his election campaign. He led his party to victory in the following general and assembly elections held in 2004  and did the same in 2009. He is the only chief minister of the state to have served again after a full term. On 2 September 2009  a helicopter carrying Reddy went missing in the Nallamala forest area. The next morning media reported that the helicopter wreckage had been found on top of Rudrakonda Hill  40 nautical miles from Kurnool. This was later confirmed by the Prime Minister's office. The five people aboard were pronounced dead at the scene of the crash.@en" .

He was a senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader in the state until he resigned from BJP on 4th August 2012 to launch a new political party named as \"Gujarat Parivartan Party\" to contest in Gujarat Vidhan Sabha Election 2012 .

In 2001  his party lost two key by-elections which led to the arrival of Narendra Modi in Gujarat as CM. Since then he has been unhappy and has called for revolt. In the 2007 State Elections  he urged his community to vote for change. He blessed the Congress Party and did not even cast his vote. But the result was a complete shock as Modi won a convincing victory with the party faring better in Patel's bastion of Saurashtra  indicating his loss of support even among his own people. His party served him a show cause notice for anti-party activities to which he is yet to reply.

He was noted for his tenacious courage and cool sagacity. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described Syed Mir Qasim as a \"great nationalist who worked selflessly in public interest and for peace and development in Jammu and Kashmir. \" Indian Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi noted that \"in the death of Qasim  the country has lost one of its pre-eminent political personalities  who symbolised our ethos of secular nationalism. \" Well-respected across the political spectrum  Syed Mir Qasim's advice and counsel was sought out by every Indian Prime Minister from Nehru to Vajpayee. Syed Mir Qasim's political career first began during India's freedom struggle against Britain  when he became a leader of the non-sectarian  pro-democracy Quit Kashmir political movement. His advocacy against monarchical rule resulted in his imprisonment as a political prisoner by the Maharaja of Kashmir Hari Singh. After India's independence  Syed Mir Qasim drafted the Kashmiri constitution and went on to serve in various State and Union positions. He is credited for having established the Indian National Congress (also known as the Congress Party and abbreviated INC) in Kashmir. Syed Mir Qasim most famously offered to resign from the office of Chief Minister in order to encourage and institutionalize the landmark Indira Gandhi-Sheikh Abdullah Accord in 1975. Syed Mir Qasim suddenly died in an ambulance near India Gate in New Delhi on 12 December 2004 at the age of 83  thirty-three years to the date from when he became Chief Minister in 1971. In accordance with his wishes  he was buried in the remote village of his birth  Dooru in Kashmir. Notably  given the general level of violent upheaval in Kashmir  his funeral was attended by thousands without incident. He was posthumously awarded India's highest civilian award by Indian President APJ Abdul Kalam in 2005.

Kannoth Karunakaran was a former Chief Minister of Kerala  Home Minister of Government of Kerala  and Cabinet Minister for Industries of Government of India. He was one of the most influential  prominent and controversial persons in Kerala politics for at least four decades and was affectionately called \"Leader\" by Congress activists. K.

In 2005 owing to differences with Sonia Gandhi and then Kerala Chief Minister  Oommen Chandy he acrimoniously split from the Congress Party and formed a breakaway party called the Democratic Indira Congress (Karunakaran).

As a partner of both the LDF and the UDF at different times  it has been a major factor in success and failure for the two coalitions. In November 2006 the party merged with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)  a member of the LDF. Later  K. Karunakaran and his daughter Padmaja returned to Indian National Congress following a spilt. However his son K. Muraleedharan dissociated himself from his father and continued in NCP. Karunakaran died on 23 December 2010 aged 92 at Ananthapuri Hospital in Thiruvananthapuram. He was often criticized for nepotism. Karunakaran?s dominating presence in the Congress party as well as other factors resulted in growing factionalism within the Kerala section of the Congress party. Karunakaran and A. K.

<http://example.com/P_K_Vasudevan_Nair> <http://example.com/CM/description> "Padayatt Kesavapillai Vasudevan Nair  popularly known as PKV  was the 9th Chief Minister of Kerala and a senior leader of the Communist Party of India (CPI). His father was Kesava Pillai. He began his political life as a student activist while studying in Union Christian College  Aluva  when the whole country was in upheaval having entered the final phase of freedom struggle. After graduating in Physics he went for study law at Government Law College  Thiruvananthapuram. PKV had his baptism in politics during his students days as an activist of the All India Students Federation (AISF). The initial years were tumultuous as AISF  which was part of the then undivided Communist Party of India (CPI)  was fighting against British imperialism. Then he joined the Communist Party of India in 1945 like many young radicals of his time who thought Congress too moderate and pro-rich. The subsequent years saw him evolve as a student and youth leader. He was the president of Travancore Students? Union in 1947 and elected as President of All Kerala Students Federation in 1948. PKV faced his first arrest during those days for making a speech against the royal ruler of Travancore. PKV was among hundreds of communists who went underground when the Communist Party of India was banned following its adoption of the Calcutta Thesis that called for armed struggle against the ruling government in 1948. He took part in underground activities from 1948?51 and was arrested in 1951 in connection with students' movement. P K Vasudevan Nair and Balraj Sahani backed the idea of All India Youth Federation. Delhi's firebrand youth leader  Guru Radha Kishan was very active in organising the first national conference of AIYF in Delhi  this wholehearted effort was visible when more than 250 delegates and observers across India representing several youth organizations of various states attended this conference. PKV had acted as president of All Kerala Students Federation  All India Youth Federation (AIYF) and Vice President of World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY). When the Communist Party split in 1964  he threw his lot with the CPI. After a long national parliamentary career  PKV returned to state politics in 1970s and was elected to the Kerala Assembly in 1977 in the election held after the Emergency. He was the Industries Minister in the Karunakaran and A.K. Antony ministries from April 1977 to October 1978. When Antony resigned in 1979 protesting against the Congress' choice of Indira Gandhi as a candidate in Chikmagalur Lok Sabha by-election  PKV became Chief Minister with the support of the Congress on October 29  1978 and occupied the post till 7 October 1979. PKV  who never went after positions  threw away his Chief Ministership after a year in office to realise the alliance with the CPI-M  ushering in an era of Left unity in the country which lead to the formation of Left Democratic Front (LDF). Suave and soft-spoken  PKV had over the years earned several friends cutting across political lines. From 1982 to 2004  PKV had stayed away from electoral politics  concentrating his time and energy on the organisational front. During this period  he mostly served as the state secretary of CPI. Whether in or out of power  he always kept a simple lifestyle and had been accessible to all sections of people. An ardent communist  the epitome of simplicity and a crusader for people's causes in his long political career spanning six decades that saw him elected to the post of Chief Minister  four-time MP and leader of CPI's Parliamentary Group in the Lok Sabha. He had left a vivid impression in the minds of the people. PKV also served as editor of Janayugom daily  the organ of the Communist Party of India between 1954-57. He was elected to the Lok Sabha from Tiruvalla in 1957 from Ambalappuzha in 1962 and from Peermade in 1967. He was in the panel of chairmen and secretary of CPI Parliamentary Party in the Lok Sabha from 1967 to 1970. He was a member of parliament from the Thiruvananthapuram constituency  elected in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections when died on 12 July 2005 following multiple organ failure brought about by chronic heart ailment and severe diabetes.@en" .

<http://example.com/Nareshchandra_Singh> <http://example.com/CM/description> "raja nareshchandra singh (21 November 1908 ? 11 September 1987)  was ruler of Sarangarh Princely State in Raigarh District  Chhattisgarh  and then an Indian National Congress politician and a Chief Minister of undivided Madhya Pradesh. He represented Sarangarh Vidhan Sabha constituency of Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly by winning General election of 1957. Raja Nareshchandra Singh was the last ruler of the Princely State of Sarangarh in the modern state of Chhattisgarh in Central India. He ruled after the death of his father Raja Jawahir Singh in January 1946 till the merger of his State into the union of India on 1 January 1948. . An alumnus of the Rajkumar College  Raipur in the footsteps of his father  Naresh Chandra Singh worked as an Honorary Magistrate in Raipur district before being inducted as the Education Minister in the administration of Sarangarh State. After independence  he joined Indian national Congress Party and won the first General Election held in 1952 to the State assembly of (old) Madhya Pradesh. He was made a cabinet minister in the cabinet of Pandit Ravi Shankar Shukla and was given the portfolio of Electricity and Public Works Departments. His tenure is remembered for the conceptualization and creation of a separate and full-fledged directorate and department for the development and welfare of the tribals with focussed state policies on these matters. A bridge on the River Mahanadi at Arang near Raipur on the Great Eastern Road in 1954 linked Madhya Pradesh  and after the bifurcation of the State  Chhattisgarh  to Orissa for the first time through an all weather motorable road. It opened gates for trading between the regions  that has flourished since then. He is credited with the smooth bifurcation of assets and manpower of the electricity department between the States when the new Madhya Pradesh came into being on 1 November 1956. This bifurcation planted the seed of what later came to be known as Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board. A RajGond tribal himself  he was famous for his rapport with  and popularity amongst the vast tribal population of Madhya Pradesh. An avid reader  he was equally famous for the rich library he possessed in his palace in Sarangarh  Chhattisgarh. He won the second  third and fourth general elections too and was a minister throughout in different Congress Ministries in Madhya Pradesh. in 1969 he became the Chief Minister for 13 days (13 March 1969 to 25 March 1969). Disgusted with the way politics had come to be practised  he resigned the office of the chief ministership and membership of the State Assembly simultaneously and quit politics. His wife  Rani Lalita Devi (died 7 November 1987) was elected unopposed in his place in the by-election that was held after his resignation. The couple had five daughters and a son. Three of those daughters entered politics: Rajnigandha Devi was a Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha 1967-71)  Kamala Devi was a member of State Assembly of Madhya Pradesh from 1971 to 1989  and a minister for 15 years  and Pushpa Devi Singh was thrice elected to the Lok Sabha Parliament in 1980  1985 and 1991.@en" .

In the post-independence era  Prakash  a member of India's Yadav community  served as Minister in charge of Planning and Development as well as the first Chief Minister of Delhi from 1952-55. His stints in the Parliament twice won him accolades as an able parliamentarian. He also made noteworthy contributions as the Union Cabinet Minister for Food  Agriculture  Irrigation and Cooperatives. The cause of depressed sections of the society  rural development and empowerment of the weaker sections were issues which were very close to the heart of Chaudhary Brahm Prakash. He was quick to realise the potential of cooperative societies in mitigating the hardships of the village folks. As early as in 1945  he started organising village and agriculture cooperatives. He was also a proponent of the Panchayati Raj institutions. He organised the National Union of Backward Classes  Scheduled Castes  Scheduled Tribes and Minorities in 1977 to work for the welfare of these weaker sections.@en" .

<http://example.com/Charan_Singh> <http://example.com/CM/description> "Chaudhary Charan Singh (Caudhar? Cara? Si?h; 23 12ember 1902 ? 29 05 1987) was the fifth Prime Minister of the Republic of India  serving from 28 07 1979 until 14 01uary 1980. Born into a Jat family in 1902  Charan Singh entered politics as part of the Independence Movement. After independence he became particularly notable in the 1950s for opposing and winning a battle against Nehru's socialistic and collectivist land use policies  for the sake of the Indian Farmer  which endeared him to the agrarian communities throughout the nation  particularly in his native Uttar Pradesh. The leader of the Bharatiya Lok Dal  a major constituent of the 01ata coalition  he was disappointed in his ambition to become Prime Minister in 1977 by Jay04akash Narayan's choice of Morarji Desai. He settled at the time for the largely honorary post of Deputy Prime Minister of India. During 1977 Lok Sabha Elections  there was not a single party  hence it was problem  which symbol has to be adopted (many parties joined the front to contest the elections after emergency was over). Hence  a request was made to Chaudhary Charan Singh (Lok Dal) and he agreed to release his party-Lok Dal's symbol \"HALDHAR'. This symbol was locked in that elections  but a promise was made to Chaudhary Charan Singh that he would be Prime Minister if the front won that election  but this promise was never kept by other party leaders  hence Chaudhary Charan Singh had a knot in his heart  resulting in a revolt; when the time came he became Prime Minister. However  the internal stresses of the coalition's government caused him to leave the government with the former Lok Dal  after being promised by Indira Gandhi the support of the Congress Party on the floor of the House in any efforts to form a government. He was sworn in as Prime Minister with the support of just 64 MPs. Charan Singh holds the record of the sole Prime Minister of India who did not face the Loksabha even for a single day during his short tenure of just a month. The day before the Lok Sabha was due to meet for the first time the Indian National Congress withdrew their support from his Bharatiya Lok Dal Government. Choudhary Charan Singh resigned and fresh elections were held six months later. He continued to lead the Lok Dal in opposition till his death in 1987  when he was succeeded as party president by his son Ajit Singh. His association with the causes dear to farming communities in the North caused his memorial in New Delhi to be named Kisan Ghat. (In Hindi  Kisan is the word for farmer. ) The Amausi Airport in Lucknow  Uttar Pradesh is also called as Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport after him. The university of Meerut city in Uttar Pradesh  India  is also named after him (Chaudhary Charan Singh University).@en" .

<http://example.com/Mayawati> <http://example.com/CM/description> "05awati (born 15 01uary 1956 in New Delhi) is an Indian politician. She served four terms as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh (UP) as head of the Bahu01 Samaj Party (BSP)  which focuses on a platform of social change to improve the welfare of the weakest strata of Indian society?the Bahu01s or Dalits  Other Backward Classes  and religious minorities. After losing the 2012 legislative assembly elections to the rival Samajwadi Party  she resigned from her post as party leader on 7 03ch 2012. Later that month she was elected by acclamation to a seat in the Rajya Sabha (upper house of Parliament). 05awati's rise from humble beginnings has been called a \"miracle of democracy\" by P. V. Narasimha Rao  former Prime Minister of India. In 1993 05awati formed a coalition with the Samajwadi Party and emerged  at 39  the youngest Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and the first female Dalit Chief Minister in India. In 1997 and in 2002 she was Chief Minister in coalition with the Bharatiya 01ata Party  the second time for a full term. 05awati's tenure has attracted praise and controversy. Millions of Dalits view her as an icon  and refer to her as Behen-ji (sister). She has been praised for her fundraising efforts on behalf of her party and her birthdays have become major media events and a symbol for her supporters. The rise in her personal wealth and that of her party have been criticised as indicative of corruption.@en" .
